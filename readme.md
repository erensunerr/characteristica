# What is this?
This is a math proof verifier. It's basically a markup language for writing proofs + a verification engine to verify them. 
It also provides an accessible software interface to interact with proof entities so that you can have fun too.
# How to set up?
I assume you have python 3 already set up and added to PATH. 
If you need help with that check [this](https://realpython.com/installing-python/) out.
After installling python execute the following commands:
1. `python -m pip install antlr4-python3-runtime` to install the lexer and parser for the language component.
2. `python main.py <filename>` is how you use it. 

You are ready to roll. I should probably write some sort of tutorial and documentation for it, 
which I maybe will do if you bug me at gerensuner@gmail.com. Jokes aside, feel free to contact me.
